# BridgeLabz-Training## 
Day 1: Introduction to the .NET Development Stack 🚀  
*Date:* 18 December 2025

### 🧠 Topics Covered

* Architecture of the **.NET Framework / .NET Core**
* Understanding **CLR, CTS, and CLS**
* Introduction to **C# Operators**
* Understanding **Access Modifiers** in C#

---

### 🏛️ Architecture of .NET

* **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**

  * Handles memory management, garbage collection, exception handling, and security
* **Base Class Library (BCL)**

  * Provides reusable classes, interfaces, and APIs (System, System.IO, System.Collections, etc.)
* **Common Type System (CTS)**

  * Ensures type safety and defines data types across all .NET languages
* **Common Language Specification (CLS)**

  * A set of rules to ensure language interoperability
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**

  * Converts Intermediate Language (IL) code into machine code at runtime

---

### ➗ Operators in C#

* **Arithmetic Operators**: `+ , - , * , / , %`
* **Relational Operators**: `== , != , > , < , >= , <=`
* **Logical Operators**: `&& , || , !`
* **Assignment Operators**: `= , += , -= , *= , /=`
* **Increment / Decrement Operators**: `++ , --`
* **Ternary Operator**: `condition ? trueValue : falseValue`

---

### 🔐 Access Modifiers in C#

* **public** – Accessible from anywhere
* **private** – Accessible only within the same class
* **protected** – Accessible within the same class and derived classes
* **internal** – Accessible within the same assembly
* **protected internal** – Accessible within the same assembly or derived classes
* **private protected** – Accessible within the same class or derived classes in the same assembly

---

### ⚡ Key Learnings

* Understood how .NET executes code internally using CLR and JIT
* Learned different categories of operators and their use cases
* Gained clarity on access control and encapsulation using access modifiers

---

### 🛠️ Practice Work

* Implemented programs using arithmetic and logical operators
* Wrote sample classes to test different access modifiers
* Explored how visibility changes across classes and assemblies

---

📌 *Day 2 focused on building a strong foundation in .NET internals and C# language fundamentals essential for enterprise development.*



# 📅 Day 3: Control Flow Statements in C#

Date: 22 December 2025

# 🎯 Objective

- To understand how a program makes decisions and repeats tasks using control flow statements in C#.

# 🧠 Topics Covered
1️⃣ Conditional Statements

Used to make decisions based on conditions.

- if statement

- if–else statement

- else–if ladder

- nested if

- switch statement

📌 Example use cases:

Checking pass/fail

Grade calculation

Menu-driven programs

# 2️⃣ Looping Statements

Used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

- for loop

- while loop

- do–while loop

- foreach loop

📌 Example use cases:

Printing tables

Iterating arrays

Repeating user input

# 3️⃣ Jump Statements

Used to change the normal flow of execution.

- break

- continue

- return

- goto (basic understanding)

# ⚙️ Key Concepts Learned

- How program execution flows line by line

- Decision-making using conditions

- Difference between entry-controlled and exit-controlled loops

- Loop control using break and continue
