# Day 2: .NET Architecture, Operators & Access Modifiers 🏗️

Date: 19 December 2025

# 🧠 Topics Covered

- Architecture of the .NET Framework / .NET Core

- Understanding CLR, CTS, and CLS

- Introduction to C# Operators

- Understanding Access Modifiers in C#

# 🏛️ Architecture of .NET

- Common Language Runtime (CLR)

- Handles memory management, garbage collection, exception handling, and security

- Base Class Library (BCL)

- Provides reusable classes, interfaces, and APIs (System, System.IO, System.Collections, etc.)

Common Type System (CTS) -> Ensures type safety and defines data types across all .NET languages

Common Language Specification (CLS) -> A set of rules to ensure language interoperability

Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler -> Converts Intermediate Language (IL) code into machine code at runtime

# ➗ Operators in C#

- Arithmetic Operators: + , - , * , / , %

- Relational Operators: == , != , > , < , >= , <=

- Logical Operators: && , || , !

- Assignment Operators: = , += , -= , *= , /=

- Increment / Decrement Operators: ++ , --

- Ternary Operator: condition ? trueValue : falseValue

# 🔐 Access Modifiers in C#

- public – Accessible from anywhere

- private – Accessible only within the same class

- protected – Accessible within the same class and derived classes 

- internal – Accessible within the same assembly

- protected internal – Accessible within the same assembly or derived classes

- private protected – Accessible within the same class or derived classes in the same assembly

# ⚡ Key Learnings

- Understood how .NET executes code internally using CLR and JIT

- Learned different categories of operators and their use cases

- Gained clarity on access control and encapsulation using access modifiers

# 🛠️ Practice Work

- Implemented programs using arithmetic and logical operators

- Wrote sample classes to test different access modifiers

- Explored how visibility changes across classes and assemblies

📌 Day 2 focused on building a strong foundation in .NET internals and C# language fundamentals essential for enterprise development.
